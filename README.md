# Money Management

ToDo:

- setup weekly meetings
- setup way of working ( review process, owners on the code, push right etc etc)
    * boards / tasks
    * review process
    * code owners
    * right of access
    * license
    * expectations
    * testing / validation solutions
    * how we spread chores evenly
    * etc etc
- prepare design docs and requirements ( we need privacy first meaning that the owner of the software/deployment
  can't see the data, maybe we need to look at Homomorphic encryption or vault based solutions)



Owners:

* Matei Marius-Micu
* Gabriel Dorneanu
* Alexandru Axentioi
